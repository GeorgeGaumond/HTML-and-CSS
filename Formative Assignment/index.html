	<div class="box"><h1>Keep Your System Secure</h1>
   	    <p>Cybersecurity has been an online concern for 50 years now. Whether you're storing important and private records of citizens, or developing a new 
        revolutionary creation that you competitors would love to steal, or just a small business that wishes to keep those online criminals at bay, we can help.
        We provide various different services to keep track of what people are up to and ensure that nobody can spy on you without us finding out.</p> 
        
        <p>Services we provide include an organised audit trail and help your organisation to apply the principle of least privilege. This will ensure that the 
        wrong person cannot access your important information at any time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box"><h1>Hacking is on the Rise</h1>
        <p>There are way more cases of hacking taking place these days. Computers are more ubiquitous than ever, with almost half of the world owning a computer
        and many with a fast internet connection. Coding is popular with many students, and many like to challenge institutions they disagree with or have 
        not yet invaded.</p>
        
        <p>An example of a hacking attack that had an extremely negative impact on a target was the Citibank hack in 1995. Vladimir Levin, 
        a programmer for Russia, stole the private details of customers by recording the phone calls they have with the bank. He managed to steal around $10,000,000. 
        Even after he was prosecuted, the government could not retrieve all the money he stole.</p>

    	<h1>The services we provide<h1>
        <p>No website is 100% secure. A hacker has numerous methods to determine how your website is insecure and slip right in in without you aware. Some hackers
        sell the information they've stolen to other criminals, whereas others just love to break their way into places they shouldn't be. No mater what drives
        them into breaking in, these people are a threat. We have an extremely professional team with decades of experience overall. They have protected various
        large companies, banks and governmental agencies from whoever is breaking in, for whatever reason.</p>
        <p>The first thing we shall do is to check every line of code in your website. Some mistakes are easy to spot, such as passwords stored in JavaScript files,
        other mistakes are more difficult to spot at first. As soon as we suspect that a hacker, worker or anyone is breaking in we shall report it imediately. 
        We will block the potential hackers and also try to identify who is responsible so they can be reported to authorities.</p>
